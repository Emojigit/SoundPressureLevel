# SoundPressureLevel
This is a fork of the one found on [MIT App Inventor official Extensions resources](https://mit-cml.github.io/extensions/). The upstream one uses depercated functions such as `Thread.suspend()`, which raises error. This fork replaced such functions.

This fork is fully compactible with the upstream one, so you can always upgrade or downgrade from or to this fork. Refer to [the documentation of the upstream](https://gldias.github.io/extensions/SoundPressureLevel/SoundPressureLevel) for how to use this extension.
